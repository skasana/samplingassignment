Balancing Dataset
SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique):
It generates synthetic samples for the minority class to balance the dataset.
Steps Taken:
Loaded the dataset.
Split the data into features (X) and target (y).
Used SMOTE to oversample the training data.

Sampling Techniques:
Sampling1: Random sampling.
Sampling2: Stratified sampling to preserve class proportions.
Sampling3: Systematic sampling with fixed intervals.
Sampling4: Cluster sampling by selecting random clusters.
Sampling5: Oversampling with replacement.

Machine Learning Models:
M1: Logistic Regression
M2: Decision Tree
M3: Random Forest
M4: Support Vector Classifier
M5: K-Nearest Neighbors

The best model overall is M3 (Random Forest).
Reasons:
Highest Accuracy
Robust Performance

It performs well regardless of the sampling technique, making it the most reliable choice for this dataset.
